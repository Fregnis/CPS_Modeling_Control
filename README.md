Projects developed for *Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical-Systems* Master Degree course at Politecnico di Torino.
Details regarding development and implementations can be found in the two pdf reports.
## Part 1: State estimation of a system
The main goal of this activity is to estimate the state of a system in different environments: in absence or presence of sensors attacks, in a target localization problem in a two dimensional indoor area, using a sparse/distributed observer implementation.
## Part 2: Distributed control a multi-agent magnetic levitation system
Our aim is to test the behavior of a multi-agents cyber-physical system with both a distributed and local observer implementation. In order to check the response of the system in different contexts, we used various network topologies and we analysed their impact on the global performances.
